Record your expenses! Don't let them go to Neverland.

This project was written in the Java programming language. It utilizes JDBC as its connection to the database.  
This project consist of **3 APIs**, as outlined below:  
**1. Register Category**  
    Categories must be registered before any expenses can be input. This step helps prevent disorganized data from being stored in the database.

    Users can enter any expense they have incurred. Don't worry if the expense is from a previous dayâ€”the date can be adjusted accordingly during each input.
